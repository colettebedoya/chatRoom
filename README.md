This is a client-server application where the server application listens to a specified 
port for client connections of those who wish to join the chat room and the client 
then joins the chatroom according to a username that they will choose for that chat session. 
Once the client has connected to the chatroom server, the client may then send a message
to the chatroom where it will then be broadcasted to all the other members (clients) 
that have signed into the chatroom.

 I choose this program because it shows the depth of what I have learned from the Networks class. 
 It takes into account the whole semester from deciding on what the protocols should be for the chatroom 
 as well as programing the client and server application include the GUI to go along with them.  
 Some of protocols that we needed to decide on how to deal with include list of online users,
 how announcements would be handled, when to include time stamps and the format of them, 
 and the protocol for the user names.
